# DW2AM
Version 0.1

## Introduction
A series of Python scripts found on GITHUB and put together here to have an 'easy' way of re-creating Spotify's fantastic "Discover Weekly Playlist" on Apple Music.

Its just a start and definitely still a work in progress...

## Credits
2 Scripts incorporated are modified versions of those found in the following project:
https://github.com/simonschellaert/spotify2am

1 script; the itunes.py script is an old one from Jim Randell that I added to to include a "new playlist" function. The script functions reasonable well on the iTunes 12.3.2.35 on Mac OS X El Capitan, despite using the 'old' appscript python library.
